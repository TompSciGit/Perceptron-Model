# Perceptron-Model
This project is to model a perceptron in python at a very low level. I will learn the basic maths behind the back propagation and some other surrounding buzz words. If successful, I will construct a multi-layered perceptron network to recogise digits. I really want to work towards a generative adversarial network for style transfer or a deep fake of some kind.
